1 - Implement the Hyperref package for URLS (Done?)
2 - Change website citation titles (Done?)
3 - Explain the Applied Algorithms Course (AA), CC and ILO more clearly (nothing is necessarily trivial or explicit)
4 - Remove first names when citing people, also where they teach
5 - Put cication after name not randomly
6 - Change citation of specific pages
7 - Change quotation marks to italic emph{}, and try not to use quotation when improper
8 - Write more assertively, state something and back it up, don't use arguably
9 - Consider using more clear subsections
10 - Table of content
11 - Remove unnecessary historical stuff
12 - Rewrite introduction to state intentions and findings
13 - Rework frontpage
14 - Rethink / Conceptualize the Narrative, what why how?
15 - Be more positive :) Solutions, not problems
16 - Cite textbook definitions by experts, not encyclopedias (Remove brittanica citation)
17 - State by notes that it is a course website in references
18 - Don't say things are inadvertantly :D
19 - Try to find never article that addresses the paradigm / algortihmic approach instead of subject based

To Do:

Fact check all references (make sure DOI / https are available when citations are missing them)

Structure:

Introduction:
- Applied Algorithms course at ITU
- Aim to create a new mandatory assignment that can be used in the course
How?
- Investigate suitable curriculum new and current
- How can / should an assignment be structured and presented
- Based on research paper Sudoku was identified as potential candidate, can be argue this is a good fit?
- Experiment conducted
- Findings

Building an assignment:
- More detailed introduction of Applied Algorithms(AA)
	- Intended Learning Outcomes
	- Structure and prior iteration
	- Prerequisites
- Core Curriculum, 
	- What is it
	- What is relevant in terms of AA
	- How can it be taught in an instance of AA
- Assignments
	- Properties of an assignments
	Practicalities: size, duration, intended learning
	(What would fit, seem thesiable in terms of AA)
	Motivational: interesting, relateable, meaningful
	(What does students want/ enjoy?
	(Maybe a part of scientific experiments vs regular programming assignments)
- Sudoku as an assignment
	- What is a Sudoku?
	- Why could it be used? (CC, AA, Nifty-ish topic)
	- Has it been tried before? (Lobo and Baliga)
	- Which approaches do we choose?
- Sudoku as an experiment
	- Structure and scalability of Sudoku
	- Generating solveable Sudokus (size, single-solution)
	- Bruteforce (Iterative vs Recursive)
	- Algorithm X (Introduction of Exact cover problem)
	- SAT-Solver (Introduction of CNF and reduction of Sudoku to CNF)
	- Horse race experimentation
- Proposed assignment for students
	- TBD
- Conclusion
	- TBD
